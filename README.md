# GatheringPositivity

With the overwhelming negative media and constant reminders of the inevitable doom we are heading towards, this project aims to do otherwise!
The aim is to spread positivity through awareness of positive advancements in the world.

This is done by retrieving content of select users through the twitter api. This is fed through sentiment analysis to determine suitability before being stored dynamically in MySQL using phpmyadmin. Then finally it is shown on the client side.


### Template use

This can be used as a template for similar twitter api focused projects (can be further built upon for multiple social media services). Fill in /config files with relevant keys and credentials and it should be all be good to go.
