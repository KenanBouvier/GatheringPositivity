# GatheringPositivity

With the overwhelming negative media and constant reminders of the inevitable doom we are heading towards, this project aims to do otherwise!
The aim is to spread positivity through awareness of positive advancements in the world that go unheard.

This is done by retrieving content of select users through the twitter api in realtime. This is fed through sentiment analysis to determine suitability before being stored dynamically in MySQL using phpmyadmin. Then finally it is shown on the client side.


This can be used as a template for similar twitter api focused projects. Fill in /php/config files with relevant keys and credentials and it should be all be good to go.
